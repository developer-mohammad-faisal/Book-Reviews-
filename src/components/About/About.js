      People are sometimes curious about Smith Family Bookstore’s history in
      this community. The store opened in 1974 when Delbert and Misa Smith
      rented a small space on Alder Street near the University of Oregon with a
      few boxes of books for sale and mostly empty shelves on the walls. From
      1974 to 1976, Smith Family Bookstore filled the small Alder Street shop
      with used books, and the store was busy with students and other people
      buying and selling textbooks and good used books. In 1977, the Smiths
      bought an empty lot on East 13th, and built a new building for their
      growing used book business. In the mid-1980s, the Smiths purchased the
      vacant Eagle’s lodge on Willamette Street, and over the next two decades,
      developed this historic building into a second downtown location. Smith
      Family Bookstore began with two simple ideas: book stores should be
      welcome places for all kinds of readers and good used books should be
      affordable. In September 2019, we closed our campus location and moved its
      inventory into our newly expanded store on Willamette Street. Our
      consolidated bookstore continues to offer over 500,000 used and new books
      in hundreds of subjects. Both old and new book-selling ways work well at
      Smith Family Bookstore. We are committed to the printed book and bookstore
      jobs for people (not warehouse robots). Our experienced staff uses
      knowledge, information, and footwork to find the books people are
      searching for or to recommend sections to browse in our stores. We believe
      bookstores are important community resources, and we work hard to keep our
      store filled with good books at fair prices. We also sell books to readers
      and collectors all over the world through our online listings on
      Abebooks.com, and we respect the ways technology has opened the global
      marketplace to our small, local business. Smith Family Bookstore buys and
      sells all kinds of books, and every reader is welcome to browse through
      our stacks. We think of ourselves as a bookstore for everyone, and our
      inventory supports this identity. We continue to work hard to remain
      relevant and competitive in this age of increasingly consolidated online
      book selling. Our bookstores offer interesting choices, good prices, and
      are a reflection of our open-minded, diverse community. If you live here
      or are just visiting, give yourself time to explore Smith Family
      Bookstore. If you live far away and need help finding a book, contact us
      through Abebooks.com.
